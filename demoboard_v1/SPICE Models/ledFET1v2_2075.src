* square ish wave is the driving signal = 1.2v
V1 G 0 DC 0 PULSE 1.2 0 1 0.003 0.003 1

* main supply, for load. Since LED can't run off 1.2v anyway
V2 vin 0 DC 3.3

* we can measure the voltage drop across 1Î© shunt = ~current through load
RD_drop test shunt 220
RI_shunt shunt L 1

* plot the gate signal
* plot current through the load
